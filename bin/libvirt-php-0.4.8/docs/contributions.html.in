    <h2><a name="hacking">Hacking libvirt-php</a></h2>

    <p>
      If you want to implement new features to libvirt-php or fix some bugs you have found you can download the source from
      our GIT repository using</p>
      <pre>git clone git://libvirt.org/libvirt-php</pre>
    <p>
      Please make sure you're using the coding style in which the code is already written (beware of spaces instead of tabs etc).
      When you have the patch prepared please send us the patch using the procedure mentioned in <a href="#sending">Sending patches</a> paragraph.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="sending">Sending patches</a></h2>
    <p>If you would like to contribute to the libvirt-php project you could write patches for it but please make sure you're following the procedure below:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>Sign up to libvirt list if you're not on it yet (libvir-list@redhat.com)</li>
       <li>Set your git username and e-mail and also set the subject prefix in the project's repository using:
     <pre>git config --local format.subjectprefix "libvirt-php PATCH"</pre>

 </li><li>Create the patch in the form of the commits and include also information about usage (example source codes maybe) and testing</li><li>Format it using <code>git format-patch -X</code> where X is the number of patch parts to be posted, for multipart patch (X is greater than 1) please use also numbering (-n) option and include the cover-letter (--cover-letter).</li><li>Send to libvir-list@redhat.com using the <code>git send-email &lt;files&gt; --to libvir-list@redhat.com</code> command where &lt;files&gt; can be <i>000*</i> to send all the patches formatted by git format-patch since git format-patch names the files starting with the 4 digit numbers.</li></ol>
