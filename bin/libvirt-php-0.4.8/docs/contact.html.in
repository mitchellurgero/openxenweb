        This is a high volume mailing list.  It is a place for discussions
        about the <strong>development</strong> of libvirt-php but it is <strong>not</strong> only for libvirt-php
        since it's mainly for libvirt itself so please be so kind and include <strong>[libvirt-php]</strong> prefix
        to your e-mail to address libvirt-php.
