 Libvirt PHP binding README
 ==========================

Libvirt-php is basically just PHP binding for libvirt virtualization toolkit.
For more information about libvirt please refer to: http://libvirt.org
The project site for php-libvirt is http://libvirt.org/php and
the documentation can be found in the doc and/or docs subdirectory of
this repository.

Implementation details
----------------------

libvirt-php is essentially a module to be loaded to your PHP module/binary.
You need to define it to be loaded in /etc/php.ini and/or for newer PHP to
/etc/php.d/*

Settings
--------

Settings can be altered in /etc/php.ini file to use or not to use the longlong
values converted into the string values using the libvirt.longlong_to_string
boolean setting and the ISO path (used by the libvirt_get_iso_images() function)
can be altered using the libvirt.iso_path path setting.

Terminology
-----------

This app should be referred to as libvirt-php or "libvirt PHP binding".
The project's old name (pre-0.4 version) was php-libvirt so both libvirt-php
and php-libvirt are acceptable although libvirt-php is preferred.

Pre-requisite software
----------------------

Where versions are noted below these are the versions tested to definitely
work. For some of them you may be able to run with earlier releases, so
please report any success to the mailing lists

 libvirt
 libxml2

documentation you can either download PHP source codes and investigate or
you could try to have a look at:

it's work in progress.
